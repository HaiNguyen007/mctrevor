# MC Trevor

CMS based on [Sir Trevor JS](http://madebymany.github.io/sir-trevor-js/).

The main goal ist to create a CMS that stores its data in flat JSON files and renders to static HTML.

## Get started

The only global depency is `npm`, the rest is managed locally.

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run bower
```

[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is used to build our application files:

```sh
$ npm run build
```

To start the `node` server and open the management interface in a brower:

```sh
$ npm start
$ open http://localhost:1337/
```

## Roadmap

- Add any kind of frontend rendering!
